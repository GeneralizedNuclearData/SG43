# Dispute Resolution
Conflict can cause progress to come to a screeching halt. While some disagreement can be healthy to improve the overall product, too much can stymie the progress and ruin relationships. In order to avoid this, the following procedure will be used to resolve disputes in the SG43 working group.

## Procedure
 1. **Try to reach consensus with reasonable discussions**; i.e., within a reasonable amount of time in current meeting. The actual meaning of "reasonable" is up to the moderator/convener of the meeting.

 2. **Table the decision**. When a decision cannot be made in the current meeting, table the decision to be discussed at a later date. When this procedure is chosen:
    1. Decide when the decision will be made. (Suggestion: no more than 6 months.) 
    2. Make formal proposal/presentation describing each side.
    3. Reach a consensus.

 3. **Decision will be made by SG43 leadership.** If, after tabling the discussion, a consensus is still not found, the decision will be made the SG43 leadership team:
    - Fausto Malvagi
    - Caleb Mattoon
    - Jeremy Conlin
