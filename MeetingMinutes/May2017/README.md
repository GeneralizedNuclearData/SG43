# May 16, 2017 WPEC
The agenda can be found [here](https://github.com/GeneralizedNuclearData/SG43/blob/master/Agendas/May2017.md).

## Minutes

1. Our users are processing codes and evaluators/evaluating codes.  While the formers are well represented in this SG43, the latter are mostly directly represented. 
   **Action**: invite evaluators and developers of evaluating codes to join the mailing list (at the least) and join the SG. 
   Who: everybody.
2. The decision process was amended with respect to the presented slides. The final agreement was something along these lines:
   We will always look for consensus (this equals to no vocal opposition). When this cannot be achieved, opposing proposals will have to be presented and discussed in the following annual meeting at NEA.  If this still does not achieve consensus, then the majority of people present in the room will rule.
3. A discussion took place about aiming for an Object Oriented interface or a Procedural (Flat) interface.  The conclusion was that we will most probably need both, so both should be specified and have at least one implementation.
